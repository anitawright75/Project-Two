# Memorease


Github link: https://github.com/rwmcbain/Project-Two

---

### Summary

* Memorease is a private online journal to log your daily life

---

### Approach

* We were inspired by wanting to create a private journal that you would have access to online. This would replace
a handwritten journal for more privacy. 

---

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Include wireframes** that you designed during the planning process
* Utilize a task runner (such as Gulp) 
* **Have at _least_ 2 models** (more if they make sense!) â€“ one representing someone using your application, and one that represents the main functional idea for your app
* **Include sign up/log in functionality**, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow
* **Utilize an ORM (such as Bookshelf.js) to create a database table structure** and interact with your relationally-stored data 
* Have **semantically clean HTML and CSS**
* Be responsive - we suggest using Materialize or Skeleton (Bootstrap is **not** allowed)
* *Bonus*: **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public on Heroku
